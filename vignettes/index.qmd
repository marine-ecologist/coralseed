`coralseed` is a spatially explicit probabilistic model aims to quantify the spatial footprint of coral larval re-seeding from restoration projects. The model is based on input from high-resolution oceanographic models (e.g. [CONNIE](https://connie.csiro.au), [oceanparcels](https://oceanparcels.org)) that track individual particles through space and time. By parameterising larval behaviour (competency, habitat specific substrate settlement preferences, swimming behaviour) individual-based probability of settlement can be modelled for 10^5^ - 10^7^ larvae. Individual-based settlement probability an dispersal paths then overlaid onto high-resolution habitat maps ([Allen Coral Atlas](https://www.allencoralatlas.org)) to form a spatially-explicit model of settlement following release of coral larvae.

`coralseed` aims to provide insight into key knowledge gaps in larval restoration:

1.  Where do larvae settle following release?
2.  What is the spatial footprint of larval reseeding projects?
3.  what are the likely densities of settled corals?
4.  What densities of adult corals (\~10cm size) are produced from reseeding and where are they located?

By varying initial model parameters (e.g. tidal currents, time of release, larval competency, larval densities, location of release sites), a simulation modelling approach can be used to quantify the likely spatial footprint and expected settlement densities, allowing for optimisation and upscaling of larval reseeding programs on the Great Barrier Reef and elsewhere.

## Installation

`coralseed` can be installed on github via `remotes`:

```{r class.source = 'fold-show', eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
#install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("marine-ecologist/coralseed")
```
